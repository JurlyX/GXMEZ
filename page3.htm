  <p><span><p class="arctic">The Arctic is a very cold place.</p></span>The Arctic is a desert because there is very little rain that happens there. Penguins do not live in the Arctic because there are many predators there and penguins would be vulnerable to attacks. Arctic animals like foxes, polar bears and arcitc wolves would hunt them for food. What is the coldest desert in the world? The largest <span><strong>AND</strong></span> the coldest desert on Earth is Antarctica, which covers 14.2 million square kilometers (5.5 million square miles). It is also the coldest desert on Earth, even colder than the planet's other polar desert, in the Arctic.The Arctic is not the only desert in the world there are other deserts in warmer climates. I am focusing on cold deserts instead of hot ones. Both types of deserts (hot and cold) have driest in comm<span id="Secret">o</span>n. Both types of deserts receive little rain, the only difference is the temperature. I am also going to tell you about plants and animals.Moss is a type of a plant. I think it grow on trees. Also some animals that live in the arcitc are polar bears, fish arcitc white har,  arcitc fox, and wolves. I also think that ploar bears eat the fish for food the arcitc fox eats the white har. Fish would eat other fish.The arcitc wolve eat arcitc hars.the arcitc har eats moss.Also the aritc desert is in the north or the soth area.    </p>
